# Adventure Game 

Based on Colossal Cave Adventure, this is a text-based adventure game where you can explore things.
The constraint for this project is that we only use the direction:
- north
- east
- west
- south

This game implements HashMap.

### Direction

- north: Forest
- east: Well House
- west: Hill
- south: Valley

### Project Guide

Use 2 Hash Maps, one for board locations, the other for next places data. The next places map is inside the board locations map.
